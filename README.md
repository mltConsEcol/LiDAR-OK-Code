# OK_LiDAR Processing

This repository contains various R scripts and other code used for processing of LiDAR data, stored in  .las format.  Files were originally in .zlas format, but converted prior to running these scripts using [ezLAS](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=787794cdbd384261bc9bf99a860a374f). 

Scripts are grouped into respective folders, scripts for which development is anticipated in the foreseeable future are indicated as Issues.

Also, note that many scripts call on opensource moodules of [LasTools](http://rapidlasso.com/), and are currently being run under a Windows OS, thus system calls in R follow Windows formatting, as opposed to Unix.
