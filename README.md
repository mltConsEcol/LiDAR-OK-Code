# OK_LiDAR Processing

This repository contains various R scripts and other code used for processing of LiDAR data, stored in  .las format.  Files were originally in .zlas format, but converted prior to running these scripts using ezLAS. 

Scripts are grouped into respective folders, scripts that are anticipated in the foreseeable future are indicated as  'Milestones' under the Issues tab for the repository.

Also, note that many scripts call on opensource moodules of [LasTools](http://rapidlasso.com/), and are currently being run under a Windows OS, thus system calls in R follow Windows formatting, as opposed to Unix.
